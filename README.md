# pronovix_mini_project
Submission for the 2021-2022 ITrainee program

My implementation is primarily based on mobile-only as of the time being.
I've tried my best to create a design that will be translatable to tablet, as well as desktop.

**IMPORTANT: My recommended resolution for your best experience is: 360x640**
