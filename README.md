This is a private repository at the moment, so please let me know if you need access to view the project on github!

My implementation is primarily based on mobile-only as of the time being.
I've tried my best to create a design that will be translatable to tablet, as well as desktop.

**IMPORTANT: My recommended resolution for your best experience is: 360x640**
