I love to pick my own colours to work with.
Given the freedom, I believe I choose some really neat colors to please the viewer's eyes!

Palette List(Colors, and why them):
- Color a
- Color b
- Color c

Images:
All of the images shown on the website are taken from The Long Dark, one of my favourite games.
Each image is a moment of in-game time I've spent in the game world.
Hopefully I've picked the best ones to show off the game as best I can.
